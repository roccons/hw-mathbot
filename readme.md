# Mathbot

Mathbot is a chatbot with which you can practice multiplication tables. Created for children, or adults too, to practice and master the tables
in a funny way.

This branch runs with Botpress v1.1. Branch master is a port and further development using the newer BotpressX version.

There is also an abandoned version using Botkit. https://github.com/roccons/hw-mathbot-botkit/
